                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Let's get started</strong></p>
                        <br>
                        <hr>
                        <p>There are several different screens in the application, as it is exposed in the <a  href="features.html">features section</a>, the application itself has a lot of different features which each has one or more screens.</p>
                        <p>The application was developed having <strong>material design</strong> in mind. We can see this by the way the application is divided into card views and the way the buttons and popups interact and display. This will be explained further along with each view</p>
                        <p>Let's look at the first screen. The first screen that is shown is right when the application is loaded, corresponding to the logo screen: </p>
                        <img src="https://github.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/blob/master/Images/ContentImages/Views/logoScreenApp.png?raw=true" style="width: 50%">
                        <p>This screen is simple enough, no text, no animations, nothing to interact with or to divert the view to. This screen has only the logo of invoice ninja. </p>
                        <p>Consisting of a dark collor palette only composed of a few basic colors</p>
                        <p>Doing the inspection of the color palette we can see that the color are a variation a degrees from black to white. Even more, as the image below shows, the color palette is basically black and white, given that most of the diferent colors are located in the bar at the top.</p>
                        <img src="https://github.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/blob/master/Images/ContentImages/ColorPalette/colorPaletteInitialScreen.PNG?raw=true" style="width: 100%">

                        <p>This screen has no font other visual components or patters.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, it is a visually mesmerizing screeen because of the <strong>contratst</strong> between the black of the logo and the white of the background</p>
                        <br>
                        <hr>


                        <p>Immediately after this screen, the user is placed on the dashboard screen. Which shows statisfics for invoices, payments, quotes, tasks &amp; expenses here we show three of this elements, they are all organized one on top of another and the user needs to swipe down in order to see the other graphics</p>
                        <img src="https://github.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/blob/master/Images/ContentImages/Views/dashboardScreen1App.png?raw=true" style="width: 25%">
                        <img src="https://github.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/blob/master/Images/ContentImages/Views/dashboardScreen2App.png?raw=true" style="width: 25%">
                        <img src="https://github.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/blob/master/Images/ContentImages/Views/dashboardScreen3App.png?raw=true" style="width: 25%">
                        <p>Looking only at this screen is very obvious that the application was developed <strong>having material design into mind</strong>. As we can see in the three images, they are all organized in a card like view, even more, we can see that some of these <strong>cards</strong> have a higher elevation than others, evident in the <strong>shadows</strong> that are displayed inbetween the date and the graphics</p>
                        <p>The<strong> color palette</strong> is shown in the image below. Doing a study of the color palette we can see that it's composed of various different shades of blue. This color palette is not something mesmerizing or out of the ordinary. In fact it is a very simple color choice, no combination of <strong>contrast and colors</strong> was used. Given the nature of the application (business) and the serious tone it needs to have, a <strong>simple</strong> color palette is probably preferable rather than a colorfoul and less serious color scheme</p>
                        <img src="https://github.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/blob/master/Images/ContentImages/ColorPalette/colorPaletteDashboard.PNG?raw=true" style="width: 100%">
                        <br>
                        <p>Let's take a look at the font choice for the application. This and every other screen has as font choice <strong>Roboto</strong>. Which is a very common choice, given it's simplistic and straight to the point design</p>
                        <p><strong>Roboto</strong> has it's own <strong>origin</strong> and <strong>meaning</strong>.</p>
                        <ul id="parragraphContent">
                            <li>Origin: Roboto was created by a desginer at google <strong>Crhistian Robertson</strong>. It was developed with the special intent of it being used on <strong>Android devices</strong> for digital usage. It has since then been categorized as the default Android font.</li>
                            <li>Meaning: Google itself ha described Roboto as <strong>modern, yet approachable</strong> with a touch of emotion.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As said previously, Roboto has a clean and straightforward design that is pleasant and familiar to look at. It's a good choice considering the nature a purpouse of the application</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Aesthetically</strong> the app is not pretty, nevertheless is not ugly to look at. Looking at the app is not very apparent that a tremendous amount of work has been put into it and that it has over 2000 commits with more than 10,000 lines of code. Even so, it is not an ugly looking app, it's <strong>simplicity</strong> fulfills it's purpouse. It is not a dense or overloaded screen. Everything looks <strong>organized &amp; structured</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, it is not a very creative or interesting design. Yes, it's simplicity fulfills it's purpouse, and given the sensitive information g handled in this application is probably best to have a simple design, but the app doesn't have the <strong>company touch</strong> that should characterize it as an application developed by invoice ninja and not any person out there.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Other than the graphics displaying the information there are no other <strong>images</strong> in this view. As it was said before, it is a very simple layout which fulfills it's purpouse but doesn't add anything to the table. As far as <strong>components</strong> we can see that it has different types of bars.</p>
                        <ul id="parragraphContent">
                            <li>Actions bar</li>
