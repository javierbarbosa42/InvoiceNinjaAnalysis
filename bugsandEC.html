                        <p>Let's see how the application behaves when regars to eventual connectivity. But first, apply a literary technique called <strong>"frame story".</strong></p>
                        <p>A frame story is a story that begins in the ending. So that's what we will do, we will begin by the ending. We will begin <strong>conclusion</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>In conclusion</strong> there is basically no eventual connectivity techniques used in the applications. As we will soon see, there is little to no alert or notification when it comes to connection. We will see that the application does not notify in any way to the user that he/she has no connection.</p>
                        <p>When perfomirming an action or task, the user is not told that the task can't be completed. It just isn't completed. </p>
                        <br>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Let's look at the first example of eventual connectivity:</p>
                        <img src="https://github.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/blob/master/Videos/gif9.gif?raw=true">
                        <p>As can be seen in this example above, when the user looses connection, whether that he/she lost wifi and data connection by purpouse or by accident. The user recieves no alert or notification telling him coonnection has been lost. </p>
                        <p>Adding to that, we can see that even changing the screen does not give any type of alert.</p>
                        <br>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Let's get a little more in detail about the eventual connectivity on the application: </p>
                        <img src="https://github.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/blob/master/Videos/gif10.gif?raw=true">
                        <p>Here, we can see a very clear example of a bad use of eventual connectivity. In this specific case, there is a problem in regars with a progress that get's stucked, with no way to move forward. In other words, <strong>stuck progress notification.</strong></p>
                        <p>As we said before, the user is not notified that the application has lost connection. But in this specific case we see a case of <strong>stuck progress notification</strong>. In which the user isn't notified that the connection has been lost and besides that, when we try to load something, we can just barely see the progress bar move and then nothing happening. </p>
                        <p>Stuck progress notification is a termn extracted from the book. In there it says that this case describes <strong>when a progress notification gets locked (not necessarily blocking the app) because of a connection problem</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Now we understand that there is a small differece between this definition and what is actually happening on screen. This definition talks about a progress bar that get's stuck loading. Therefore it never finishes, however in this case we can se that the progress bar loads for a second and then stops. Nevertheless, this definition is the closest one to what is actually happening on screen. This because we can just barely see the progress notification and nothing happens afterwards and also because we can see that the application itself <strong>is not locked.</strong> We can continue to use the application (technically), although we are not goint to be able to do much with it.</p>
                        <p>After more tries we were able to replicate the error with a far better video to show: </p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>As can be seen by the previous gifs, the application does not do much when it comes to eventual connectivity. This next gif shows excatly that: </p>
                        <img src="https://github.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/blob/master/Videos/gif12.gif?raw=true">
                        <p> In the gif shown above, we can see that the application does not notify the user when the connection is lost, instead it just acts normally as if nothing had happened. There is no generic message, no message with exception trace, there no content lost.</p>
                        <p>The graphics  still load after going through different screens and going back to the dashboard. Also the rest of the content is still there, going through the different screens we can see that the elements of each screen are still available.</p>
                        <p>The application is <strong>not locked</strong> either</p>
