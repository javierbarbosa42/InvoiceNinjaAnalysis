                        <h3>List Payments</h3>
                        <p>In the meantime, we’re going to take you through the Payments list page to give you an idea of the complete payment picture.</p>
                        <p>To view the Payments list page, click on the Payments tab on the main sidebar. This will open the Payments list page.</p>
                        <p>Understanding the Payments List Page</p>
                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>The Payments list page displays a summary of all payments once they have been received. Payments are recorded in two ways:</p>
                        <ol id="parragraphContent">
                            <li><strong>Automatic payment</strong>: If your client has paid you via any of Invoice Ninja’s 45+ payment partners, the payment will be automatically recorded in the Payments list. You will be notified by Invoice Ninja on your Dashboard page in the Payments table, and also via email (if you have chosen the relevant notification setting on the Settings / Notifications page).</li>
                            <li><strong>Manual payment</strong>: If your client has paid you via cash, check, bank transfer, credit card or any other payment system not linked to Invoice Ninja, you will need to enter the payment manually on the Payments / Create page.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Whether automatic or manual entry, the Payments list page presents an overview of all payments received in a user-friendly table format. Now, we’ll take you through the various columns in the Payments table from left to right:</p>
                        <ul id="parragraphContent">

                            <li><strong>Transaction Reference</strong>: If you have been paid automatically via one of the payment partners, the payment reference number generated by the payment system will be automatically recorded here. If you have entered a manual payment, the Transaction Reference will display the information you entered in the Transaction Reference field when entering the payment. If you left the Transaction Reference field blank when entering the payment, the system will automatically display “Manual entry” as the Transaction Reference on the Payments list.</li>
                            <li><strong>Method</strong>: The method of payment used, ie. PayPal, Bank Transfer, Visa, etc</li>
