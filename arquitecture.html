                        <h3>Local-Private</h3>

                        <p>This refers to storing data in SQLite. This app does not use this storage strategy in implementation but makes use of the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image">cached_network_image</a> library to create the cache and keep the images in the app.</p>

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <h3>External-Public</h3>

                        <p>This refers to storing data in an external folder inside the phone, like the sd card. <br>
                        By the way it is implemented (shown below) there is no option for the user to save the picture on the phone, once is selected or confirmed after taking the picture, the app will upload it to the server.</p>

                        <br>

                        <h3>Remote Storage</h3>

                        <p>Data is fetched and saved remotely using the web API. Recall the app is strongly related to the web app due to it relying on its service to save and get information. This API uses JSON serialized objects to communicate. As follows: </p>
                        <br>

                        <img src="https://github.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/raw/master/Images/ContentImages/API-load.png
" height="300" width="700" alt="API load data">

                        <p>As you can see, the loading process involves forming an url to fetch data from. It also sends the auth status to the remote service so it can check if the request is being made by an authorized client. Saving uses the same principle:</p>
                        <br>

                        <br>

                        <h3>Cache and data fetching strategies</h3>

                        <p>To avoid needing to fetch multimedia files from the server, cahce is used to keep images locally in the app. With this in mind, they make an implementation of the of the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image">cached_network_image</a> package in a file called &quot;cached_image.dart&quot; that returns a cached network image or a CircularProgressIndicator if it is not already cached:</p>
                        <br>

                        <img src="https://github.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/raw/master/Images/ContentImages/Cached_image.png
" height="200" width="500" alt="API save data">

                        <br>

                        <p>The fetching strategy used is pull-based. Only when the user asks for cached data is it
downloaded and kept within the app. When the user first tries to load a filter a spinner is shown,
and on airplane mode, a spinner is shown forever.</p>

                        <h3>Architectural patterns</h3>

                        <br>

                        <p>Taken by the CEO's web blog he explains how for Invoice Ninja they implemented a MVC combined with the popular Redux for state managing. The project is organized in this fashion as follows: </p>

<img src="https://github.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/raw/master/Images/ContentImages/ProjectStructure.png
" width="500" alt="API save data">

                        <p>Where data directory contains the Model, ui directory contains the view and redux directory contains the controller/domain.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The MVC pattern implemented with redux looks like this:</p>
                        <br>

                        <br>

                        <p>Where the middleware and reducer function as the controller, the store is used as the model and view keeps the same.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The API shown in the above figure is actually how the app makes calls to the backend. We actually had to implement the backend by hand in order to have the full features of the mobile app the webapp implemented by us can be found at <a href="http://davidnino.social/login">Invoice Ninja self-hosted</a>. The mentioned backend looks as follows:</p>

                        <h3>Design patterns</h3>

                        <br>

                        <h4>Repository</h4>
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <p>Its used to handle data query and save data. This is implemented for the entities in each feature.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h4>Builder</h4>
                        <br>
                        <img src="https://github.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/raw/master/Images/ContentImages/Builder.png
" width="600" alt="Repo style">
                        <br>
                        <p>Builder pattern is used to make a flexible build of different entities. The picture represents the creation of the dashboard which is a feature. This pattern is also used to build the state of the objects.</p>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Interceptor</h4>
                        <br>
                        <img src="https://github.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/raw/master/Images/ContentImages/Middleware.png
" width="600" alt="Repo style">
                        <br>
                        <p>The interceptor is the middleware of our project. It centralizes the different interactions there can be done with an entity. The goal is to make the code maintainable.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Singleton and factory</h4>
                        <br>
                        <img src="https://github.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/raw/master/Images/ContentImages/Singleton.png
" width="600" alt="Repo style">
                        <br>
                        <p>Singleton is used for creating and using one and only one state for the entities in each feature. The image above shows how the state for the Quote is created. If there is already an existing Quote state, it is returned. Otherwise, it creates the new state.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Strategies</h3>

                        <br>

                        <p>We now are going to take a look at the strategies used by the developers to work more efficiently and optimize performance based on the CEO's blog on flutter.</p>

                        <br>

                        <h4>No replicated code</h4>

                        <p></p>

                        <p>Patterns of duplicate code were converted out to a widget. As a result, widgets can be incredibly small but used throughout the app they both reduce code and make it easier to apply changes later on.</p>

                        <br>

                        <h4>View models</h4>

                        <p>Separation of the UI from view logic. For example, the view model would handle preparing data from the central store to the format needed by the view and provide methods to dispatch actions to update the store.</p>

                    <h4>Completers</h4>

                    <p>They pass the context in in which an action was trigered and the middleware uses the contextr.</p>

                    <h4>Enums</h4>

                    <p>Invoice Ninja has many modules, for example: clients, products, invoices, tasks, expenses, … They all provide similar functionality (list, view, edit, archive, delete, restore) and then some provide other actions such as invoice or email.</p>

                    <p>To support this they built enums. In this case they have an EntityType enum and an EntityAction enum.</p>

                    <br>

                    <h4>Persistence</h4>

                    <p>Their solution to persistence is to split up the core parts of the store (data, UI and auth) to persist each part separately. As a user makes changes to a new record they constantly persist the UI store without needing to persist the data store which could potentially have tens of thousands or records.</p>

                    <p>If a user starts to create a new record and then quits the app they present the partially completed record when the app is relaunched. This is handled in the code by having any action which requires persistence (such as when data is loaded or modified) implement the PersistData or PersistUI abstract classes. The usage of Persist UI is as follows:</p>

                    <br>

                    <h4>Abstract clases</h4>

                    <p>We have two types of data in the app: editable entities which the user can create and edit (such as clients and invoices) and static data which can be referenced but not changed (such as the list of languages or currencies).</p>

                    <p>To support typical interactions in the app a SelectableEntity abstract class was created. The built_value classes then implement the class. This provide a way for each entity type to define how it should be presented and searched in a list, the subtitle of the ListTile is then used to show the matching field. This class is implemented by both types of data.</p>

                    <p>The editable entities implement the BaseEntity class which provides shared functionality such as archiving and deleting and handles filtering the list by their state (active, archived or deleted) and status (ie, draft, sent, paid, …).</p>
