                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <p>For the dynamic analysis of the app we took every feature of the app and gave it heavy use for a period of time to see how it responded on the phone. To achieve this, we used the android studio profiler on the android-side part of the app. This gave us a tool to see a graphic representation of how the app was performing on different aspects as CPU usage, memory usage, network usage and energy. After running these tests, we found that every feature behaved similarly. The reason for this at the conclusions section.</p>
                        <br>


                        <h3>Dashboard</h3>
                        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/master/Images/Dashboard/Dashboard_PerformanceOverview.png" height="300" width="700" alt="Dashboard performance overview">

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <p>The abobe graph is showed as an overview of the performance. For the test, this view was reloaded and played with many times as it can be seen in the interaction section (represented as the red dots on top of the image). We tried all possible interactions of this view to test how well it was managed. We will now dive on detail on the different aspects the profiler shows.</p>

                        <br>

                        <h4>CPU</h4>
                        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/master/Images/Dashboard/Dashboard_CPU.png" width="700" alt="Dashboard CPU usage"><br>
                        <br>

                        <p>Even though the graph shows moments where there are more than one thread running at the same time, this are used for little cases and most of them are used in Future calls and on async methods. This might show how the usage of multithreading is being used, but by reading the docs we know dart is a single threaded language, although there is Isolates which can serve as new threads in execution. We will discuss threading in the Multithreading section.</p>

                        <br>

                        <h4>Memory</h4>
                        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/master/Images/Dashboard/Dashboard_Memory.png" width="700" alt="Dashboard Memory usage">
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <p>As shown above, the memory for this feature never surpasses the 256MB limit. Most of this memory is used is for the app heap to run code. If we divide the memory used by packages, the shallow size for the different packages using memory are the java package for the use of primitive values and data structures.</p>

                        <br>

                        <h4>Network</h4>
                        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/master/Images/Dashboard/Dashboard_NW.png" width="700" alt="Dashboard Network usage">

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <p>For the network analysis, because of the nature of the feature, the network usage is as little as the user wants to reload the data in the view. For this reason, there is almost no network usage between the requests for reload.</p>

                        <br>

                        <h4>Energy</h4>
                        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/master/Images/Dashboard/Dashboard_EN.png" width="700" alt="Dashboard energy usage">

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <p>There is a positive correlation between the network usage and the energy peaks on the above graph. Although there are peaks in the energy consumption, this consumption is always categorized as light. </p>

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Clients</h3>
                        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/master/Images/Clients/Clients_Overview.png" width="700" alt="Clients performance overview">
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <p>For the clients overview the above graph shows a similar behavior as the dashboard feature. Low use of network and energy outstand in this overview. Similar usage of memory and very low usage of CPU except for the launching of the app (beginning). It important to note how in the activity representation of the app (green line below the interactions in red dots), due to one of the features of the app that let send emails to their clients, at the moment of tapping that option, the app opens up the default emailing app of the phone so Invoice Ninja is put to sleep.  </p>

                        <br>

                        <h4>CPU</h4>
                        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/master/Images/Clients/Clients_CPU.png" width="700" alt="Clients CPU usage"> <br>

                        <br>

                        <p>The CPU usage for this feature is similar to the Dashboard, giving an average use of less than 20% inside the app. </p>

                        <br>

                        <h4>Memory</h4>
                        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/master/Images/Clients/Clients_Memory.png
                                  " width="700" alt="Clients Memory usage">
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <p>Bear in mind that there is a gap at the start of the trace that is recording memory usage outside the app. Once again, the biggest use of memory is by native libraries, followed by code and graphics. There is another category that sums the rest of usages of memory called “Others” that is also important. We see how there is a slight but continious increase on the use of the memory even after the garbage collector disposes the unused references that might show that there is a memory leak.</p>

                        <br>

                        <h4>Network</h4>
                        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/master/Images/Clients/Clients_NW.png" width="700" alt="Clients Network usage">

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <p>The network is used in this feature is used to retrieve data from the server on client contacts. That is why the graph shows peaks at the beginning (fetching) and at the end of the profiling, where new contacts were added.</p>

                        <br>

                        <h4>Energy</h4>
                        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/master/Images/Clients/Clients_EN.png" width="700" alt="Clients energy usage"> <br>               <br>
                        <p>The energy profiling of this feature shows how the energy use is low for this feature. </p>
                        <br>

                        <p> As shown above different features behave the same way one from other. The CPU, memory, network and energy usages are represented in a similar fashion by the graphics. For the next features, the overview and specifics is going to be showed:  </p>

                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <p>For the products feature analysis, we take into account that this feature is very similar to clients feature where there is a list of products that can be added deleted or modified. So, the behavior of the performance is similar.</p>

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <p>This feature shows peak of use at the end of the profiling. This is due to use of the camera to take and upload pictures of the invoices sent or to be sent. The piece of code that does the trick is the following:</p>

                        <img src="https://github.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/raw/master/Images/ContentImages/CameraUsage.png" height="150" alt="Invoices CPU usage"> <br>

                        <br>

                        <p>We will now see how the usage of the camera impacts the different aspects of the profiling.</p>

                        <h4>CPU</h4>
                        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/master/Images/Invoice/Invoice_CPU.png" height="300" width="700" alt="Invoices CPU usage"><br>

                        <br>

                        <p>As mentioned before, the use of the camera to take pictures causes a raise on the CPU usage because when opening the camera app, has to put Invoice Ninja to sleep and manage the stack to put the camera on top. This causes a rise on the CPU use that has not been seen in the previous features.</p>

                        <br>

                        <h4>Memory</h4>
                        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javierbarbosa42/InvoiceNinjaAnalysis/master/Images/Invoice/Invoice_Memory.png

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <p>Memory is one of the performance aspects that evidently is used more when taking a picture. Opening and taking the picture so it can be sent afterwards requires the use of the cache to point at the image that is going to be uploaded. It is normal for the memory to rise a bit once the image is taken, but with our tests we found out that the images that we uploaded are in average 5MB of size but the rise on memory shown in the profiling is more than 5MB, which we can conclude to be a memory leak. Reading in depth about memory leaks in flutter, we see there is issues on the flutter github repo regarding memory leaks, there is many reasons why this could be happening, but there is a probable cause; the state it's not being disposed properly after alterning from apps.</p>

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <p> Once the picture was taken, the app starts uploading it to the server. This process causes a peak on the network usage. </p>

                        <br>

                        <h4>Energy</h4>

                        <p>As mentioned before, there is a positive correlation on the network usage and the battery expenditure. The more network is used, the more battery is consumed.</p>

                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <p>The payment feature was tested creating, saving, editing and reloading the payment sections several times.  This is the reason why there is some peaks at the network section. But besides this continuous reloading, there was not peaks on the energy usage. The reason why this happens is that fetching data wirelessly is less energy consumptive than uploading data (Kalic, G. 2012. &quot;Energy consumption in Android phones when using Wireless communication technologies&quot;). </p>

                        <p>The quotes feature also lets its users upload documents and pictures in the process of generating a quote. This test was made creating, editing, listing, filtering and uploading quotes. Generating a quote included uploading a picture or document. As in the invoice feature, the quote feature shows a higher usage of memory, network and energy because of the process of uploading the picture. Although there is a higher usage of resources, this usage keeps being categorized as light to medium.</p>

                        <p>In this feature we also find a memory leak. The as with the invoices feature, we see there the camera use causes this problem probably because of the state. The desicion from the developers to save parts of the state separately and then piece it back together when initializing the state on load might be impacting this memory usage for the camera library.</p>

                        <p>For the projects features profiling, we created new projects and edited existing ones. We also added tasks and clients to existing projects making new associations. To make this test more demanding, we reloaded the data several times which reflects on the network graph. The first time of reload we made changes on the web app before entering the app so the peak on the network is due to this fact. The other components of the profiler behave as expected. </p>

                        <p>The tasks feature lets its users on top of creating new tasks, edit them and assign them to projects and clients, it also lets calculate the price by recording the time taken to finish the task. Time recording feature uploads the starting and stopping times to the server, therefore in the network graph there is several peaks. Notice how the number of peaks is even, representing a starting and stopping point.
                            Another noteworthy point in the graphs is that even though there are peaks on the network usage, these peaks does not represent a high or heavy usage of network (just up to 5KB/s). This is the reason why it does not impact on the battery usage.

                        <p>For the vendors feature we also created, edited and saved several vendors. To create and save a vendor there are many input points that are distributed on different views. As we will discuss on the architecture section, Invoice Ninja developers adopted a pattern that saved each user change on the form, so the user didn’t lose the information if he switched between apps. This is denoted in the memory graph, where the memory consumed keeps growing until the user saves the form.  There are also some peaks on the network graph that display each time some modification of the vendor form is saved. </p>

                        <p>We see a major memory leak in this feature. After the garbage collector is used, the memory peaks and mantains its higher use. A possible sotution to this problem would be the use of an external library called <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/kisrs">Kisrs</a> that, as well as Redux, manages the state but also lets its users dispose this state implementing a method "dispose".</p>

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <p>The static profiling tool used was the dart analyzer that comes with the flutter plugin for android studio. We found out that this analyzer is very customizable but also strict out of the box. <br>
                            We were surprised to find out that running this static analyzer found no code errors on the Invoice Ninja project. This probably has to do with the fact that Hillel Coren, CEO and main developer of the flutter app is actually a GDE (google developer expert) for flutter. We were still hesitant whether to trust this analyzer, so we tested it on our own project (transport app) and got a bittersweet feeling finding out that there was almost 70 warnings and bugs. <br> In conclusion, the Invoice Ninja project doesn’t have even a single error or warning. </p>

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <p>Dart executes one operation at a time, one after the other meaning that as long as one operation is executing, it cannot be interrupted by any other Dart code. In other words, Dart in which flutter is based, is a single threaded language. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>One might think that the usage of an object called Future or the async statement on a method is a way of parallel processing, but it actually is not. There is a single internal and invisible process called the &quot;Event Loop&quot; (that has an event queue to keep track of the code to be executed) in which a Future or async method interacts by pushing code into the event queue. There is many usages of both the Future and async methods in the project but these are not different threads (&quot;Isolate&quot; in flutter lingo) running.</p>

                        <p>Instead, an Isolate is the implementation of the notion of Thread but there is a major difference, Isolates do not share memory between them. <strong>Invoice Ninja does not make use of this type of multithreading technique</strong>. </p>
