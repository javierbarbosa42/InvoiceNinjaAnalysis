                        <p>For Pro Plan users, the Quotes function streamlines your invoicing activity, from the moment you create and send a price quote for a particular job, until the quote is accepted, you invoice the job, receive payment and provide a receipt. With the Quotes function, you can automatically convert accepted quotes into invoices in a swift one-click action. Keeping track of your projected work schedule and potential income, the Quotes feature gives you even greater control of your freelance activity.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>List Quotes</h3>

                        <p>As a freelancer, many jobs – whether big or small – will begin as a quote. How so? Well, a client expresses interest in your skills or product, but wants to know how much it’s going to cost, in advance. With the Quotes feature of Invoice Ninja, available to Pro Plan users only, you can easily create a price quote and send it to the client up front, helping them make the decision to commit, and helping you keep track of your projected work schedule and income.</p>
                        <p>Once the price quote is accepted by the client, the Invoice Ninja system enables automatic creation of an invoice that imports all the quote data, so your quotes and invoices are linked, organized and easily traceable. An advanced Invoice Ninja feature, Quotes is truly the cherry on top, giving you maximum functionality from A to Z in your invoicing activity.</p>
                        <p>To view your Quotes list page, click the Invoices tab on the main taskbar, and select Quotes from the drop-down menu. This will open the Quotes list page.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>The Quotes list page displays a table of all your quotes, at every stage, whether at the drafting stage, sent to the client, accepted by the client and converted to invoice, or archived/ deleted quotes. Use your Quotes list to get a better grasp of where you stand in terms of possible future projects and income.</p>
                        <p>Now, we’ll explore all the tabs on the main header bar of the table from left to right:</p>

                        <ul id="parragraphContent">

                        </ul>
                        <p>Action The Action button provides a range of possible actions, depending upon the status of the quote. To view the actions, hover your mouse over the Action area of the relevant quote entry and a gray Select button will appear. Click on the arrow at the right side of the button to open a drop-down list. Here are the available actions:</p>
                        <ul id="parragraphContent">

Quotes can be filtered according to the client name or quote number, or elements of these data. Let’s filter the table for a client named “Best Ninja”. You can type “best ninja”, or “best” or “ninja”, or even “bes”, or “nin”, or “ja”, or any other grouping of letters in the client name. Alternatively, you can filter according to quote number. The filter function will automatically locate and present the relevant entries.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Archiving/Deleting</h3>
                        <p>To archive or delete a quote, hover over the quote entry row, and open the Action drop-down list. Select Archive quote or Delete quote from the list. The Quotes table will automatically refresh, and archived or deleted quotes will no longer appear in the list.</p>
                        <p>You can also archive or delete one or more quote via the gray Archive button that appears at the top left side of the Quotes list page. To archive or delete quotes, check the relevant quotes in the check boxes that appear in the far left column next to the quote number. The number of quotes selected for archiving/deleting will automatically update and show on the Archive button. Then click on the Archive button, open the drop-down list and select the desired action.</p>
                        <p>Want to view archived or deleted quotes? Check the box marked Show archived/deleted quotes, situated to the right of the Archive button. The table will automatically refresh, and will now feature the full list of quotes, including current, archived and deleted quotes.

                        <ul id="parragraphContent">
                            <li><strong>Deleted quotes</strong> are displayed with a red Deleted button. To restore deleted quotes, hover on the red Deleted button. A gray Select button will appear. Click on the Select arrow, and select Restore quote in the drop-down list.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Create Quote</h3>
                        <p>To create a new quote, go to the Invoices tab on the main taskbar, open the drop-down menu, and click on New Quote. This will open the Quotes / Create page.</p>
                        <p>How to Create a New Quote</p>
                        <p>When you open the Quotes / Create page, the Invoice Ninja system will automatically create a new, empty quote for you to complete. Note that the quote entry page is very similar in format to the invoice entry page. This makes converting the quote to an invoice extremely logical and simple.</p>
                        <p>The top section of the quote contains a range of important information specific to the client and the quote. Let’s explore them one by one:</p>
                        <ul id="parragraphContent">
                            <li><p><strong>Client</strong>: Click on the arrow at the right end of the Client field. Select the relevant client from the client list. TIP: You can create a new client while creating a new quote. Simply click on the Create new client link, situated below the Client field on the Quotes / Create page. A pop-up window will open, enabling you to complete the new client’s details. Then continue creating the quote for this new client.</p>
                                <p>Alternatively, once you’ve selected an existing client from the drop-down client list, you can edit the client or view the client details. Click the Edit Client or View Client links situated directly below the client field. If you click Edit Client, the Edit Client pop-up box will open. If you click View Client, the client summary page will open in a new window.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><p><strong>Quote Date</strong>: The date of creation of the quote. Click the calendar icon to select the relevant date.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><p><strong>Valid Until</strong>: The last date that the quote is valid and can be accepted by the client. Click the calendar icon to select the relevant date.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><p><strong>Partial</strong>: In the event that you will be billing the client for a partial amount of the quote, enter the amount in the Partial field. This will be automatically applied to the quote, and later, to the invoice.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><p><strong>Quote #</strong>: The quote number is assigned automatically when you create a new quote, in order of chronology. You can manually override the default quote number by entering a different number in the Quote # field.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><p><strong>PO #</strong>: The purchase order number. Enter the purchase order number for easy reference.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><p><strong>Discount</strong>: Applying a discount to a quote is the same as applying a discount to an invoice. To learn how to apply a discount, refer to section 5.11 of the User Guide.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Now that we’ve completed the general quote information, it’s time to finish creating your quote by specifying the job/s you’re billing for, the amounts due for each job/line item, discounts and final balance. Let’s explore the various columns of the quote, from left to right along the orange header bar:</p>
                        <ul id="parragraphContent">
                            <li><strong>Item</strong>: This is the name of the item you are quoting for. You can either enter the details manually, or by selecting one of the set items created by you at the Product Settings stage. To select a set item, click on the arrow at the right side of the item bar and choose the relevant item from the drop-down list. To enter the item manually, click inside the field and enter the item. Here are some examples of an item: 1 hour programming services OR 5 pages translation OR 1 hour consulting.</li>
                            <li><strong>Description</strong>: Add more information about the item. This will help the customer better understand the scope of the price quote, and is also useful for your own reference.</li>
                            <li><strong>Unit Cost</strong>: The amount you intend to charge per unit of items. For example, let’s say your item is “1 hour consulting”, and you charge $80 for an hour of consulting – that is, for 1 item unit. Then you’ll enter 80 in the Unit Cost field. Note: If you have selected a set item, the unit cost that you pre-defined at the Product Settings stage will apply by default. You can manually override the default unit cost by clicking in the Unit Cost field and changing the value.</li>
                            <li><strong>Quantity</strong>: The number of units included in the quote. Continuing the above example, let’s say you need to quote for 3 hours of consulting, enter the number 3 in the Quantity field.</li>
                            <li><strong>Line Total</strong>: This is the amount quoted for the particular line item. Once you have entered the Unit Cost and Quantity, this figure will be calculated automatically. If you change either value at any time during creation of the quote, the Line Total will adjust accordingly.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Beneath and to the right of the line item section, you’ll find the Total value of the quote. It’s made up of a number of figures, including Subtotal, Paid to Date and Total:</p>
                        <ul id="parragraphContent">
                            <li><strong>Subtotal</strong>: This is the amount quoted before other payments made to date are included in the quote calculation, such as Partial payments, Credits, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Paid to Date</strong>: The amount paid to date towards the value of the quote, including partial payments and credits.</li>
                            <li><strong>Total</strong>: The final value of the quote for the specified job(s), after partial payments and credits have been deducted from the quoted amount.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Directly to the left of the Balance Due section, you’ll see a text box with three tabs to choose from:</p>
                        <ul id="parragraphContent">
                            <li><strong>Note to Client</strong>: Want to write a personal or explanatory note to the client? Enter it here.</li>
                            <li><strong>Quote Terms</strong>: Want to set terms to the quote? Enter them here. The terms will appear on the quote. If you want to make these the default terms for all quotes, check the Save as default terms box. Then these terms will automatically appear on each quote you create. Need to change the default terms? Click Reset Terms, and the text box will clear. You can enter new terms or leave blank.</li>
                            <li><strong>Quote Footer</strong>: Want to enter information to appear as a footer on the quote? Enter it here. The text will appear at the bottom of the quote. If you want to make this the default footer for all quotes, check the Save as default footer box. Then this footer will automatically appear on each quote you create. Need to change the default footer? Click Reset footer, and the text box will clear. You can enter a new footer or leave blank.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Below the quote data fields, you’ll see a row of colorful buttons, giving you a range of options:</p>
                        <ul id="parragraphContent">
                            <li><strong>Blue button – Download PDF</strong>: Download the quote as a PDF file. You can then print or save to your PC or mobile device.</li>
                            <li><strong>Green button – Save Quote</strong>: Save the last version of the quote. The data is saved in your Invoice Ninja account. You can return to the quote at any   time to continue working on it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Orange button – Email Quote</strong>: Email the quote directly via the Invoice Ninja system to the email address specified for the client.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gray button – More Actions</strong>:</li>
                        </ul>
