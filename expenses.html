                        <br>

                        <h3>List Expenses</h3>
                        <p>To view the Expenses list page, click on the Expenses tab on the main taskbar.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>The Expenses list page displays a summary of all business expenses that you choose to enter. Apart from giving an overview of all your recorded expenses in a table format, you can also carry out a number of important actions from the Expenses page. First, let’s take a look at the various columns in the Expenses table from left to right:</p>
                        <ul id="parragraphContent">
                            <li><strong>Vendor</strong>: The name of the vendor</li>
                            <li><strong>Client</strong>: The name of the client for whom the expense is relevant</li>
                            <li><strong>Expense</strong>: Date The date the expense occurred</li>
                            <li><strong>Amount</strong>: The expense amount</li>

                            <li><strong>Public Notes</strong>: The notes entered when creating the expense (this becomes the item description if the expense is converted to an invoice)</li>
                            <li><strong>Status</strong>: The current status of the expense: Logged (blue), Pending (orange), Invoiced (gray), Paid (green)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The final column to the right is the Action column. To view the actions, hover your mouse over the Action area of the relevant expense entry and a gray Select button will appear. Click on the arrow at the right side of the button to open a drop-down list. These are the action options:</p>
                        <ul id="parragraphContent">
                            <li><strong>Edit Expense</strong>: Edit the expense information on the Edit Expenses page.</li>
                            <li><strong>Invoice Expense</strong>: Convert the expense to a client invoice.</li>
                            <li><strong>Archive Expense</strong>: Click here to archive the expense. It will be archived and removed from the Expenses list page.</li>
                            <li><strong>Delete Expense</strong>: Click here to delete the expense. It will be deleted and removed from the Expenses list page.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Expense Categories</h3>
                        <p>In order to better manage your business expenses, you can create custom categories and assign them to various expenses. For example, you may decide to create a category for “Office Supplies”, or “Events” or perhaps “Salaries”. Whichever categories you decide you need, creating them is super simple. First, you’ll need to open the Expense Categories page.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>To open the Expense Categories page:</h3>
                        <p>Click on the gray Categories button that appears above the Expenses table. The page features a list of all existing categories.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>To create a new Expense Category:</h3>
                        <p>Click on the blue New Expense Category + button located at the top right of the Expense Categories page. On the Expense Categories/ Create page, enter the name of the category, and click Save. The new category will now appear in the list on the Expense Categories page. When you create a new expense, you can apply a category from your list to the expense.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>To edit an Expense Category:</h3>
                        <p>On the Expense Categories page, click on the gray Select button in the far right column of the category entry, and select Edit Category.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>To archive an Expense Category:</h3>
                        <p>On the Expense Categories page, select the relevant category, and click the gray Archive button above left of the Expense Categories table. The category will be permanently removed from the Categories list. To view archived categories, check the Show archived/deleted box next to the Archive button. The category will now be viewable again in the Expense category table, marked with an orange Archived status. To restore the archived category, click on the gray Select button in the far right column of the category entry, and select Restore expense category.</p>
                        <p>Here’s a fast, easy way to get to the Vendors page from the Expenses list page. Click the gray Vendors button located at the top right of the page, to the right of the Categories button.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Filter</h3>
                        <p>To filter the Expenses list, enter the filter data in the Filter field, situated at the top right of the page, to the left of the gray Categories button. Expenses can be filtered according to Vendor name.  Enter the name or parts of the name, and the filter function will automatically locate and present the relevant entries.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Archiving/Deleting Expenses</h3>
                        <p>To archive or delete an expense, hover over the expense entry row, and open the Action drop-down list. Select Archive Expense or Delete Expense from the list. The Expenses table will automatically refresh, and archived or deleted expenses will no longer appear in the list.</p>
                        <p>You can also archive or delete one or more expense via the gray Archive button that appears at the top left side of the Expenses list page. To archive or delete expenses, check the relevant expenses in the check boxes that appear in the far left column next to the vendor name. The number of expenses selected for archiving/deleting will automatically update and show on the Archive button. Then click on the Archive button, open the drop-down list and select the desired action.</p>
                        <ul id="parragraphContent">
                            <li>Deleted expenses are displayed with a strikethrough line and a red Deleted button in the right hand column of the expense entry. To restore deleted expenses, hover on the red Deleted button. A gray Select button will appear. Click on the Select arrow, and select Restore expense in the drop-down list.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Invoice</h3>
                        <p>Are you billing a client directly for an expense? With the Invoice button on the Expenses list page, you can automatically convert an expense to an invoice in one simple click. To create an invoice for an expense, first you’ll need to select the expense in question. Select an expense by checking the box located in the far left column of the relevant entry. Then click the blue Invoice button located at the top left of the Expenses table. The expense will be converted automatically to a new invoice.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Create Expense</h3>

                        <p>To ensure your business records are meticulous and organized, enter all your expenses in to your Invoice Ninja account.
