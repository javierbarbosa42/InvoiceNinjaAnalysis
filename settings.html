                            <li><strong>Company Size</strong>: Select the company size from the options in the drop down list</li>
                            <li><strong>Industry Select</strong>: the industry your company belongs to from the options in the drop down list</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Address</h3>
                        <p>Complete the relevant address detail in each field. For the Country field, start typing the name of your country, and the autocomplete function will offer you options to select from in a drop down list. Select the relevant country.

                        <h3>Email Signature</h3>
                        <p>Create your unique company signature, which will appear on every email that is sent on your behalf from the Invoice Ninja system. First, enter free text in the text box. This may include your company name, address, phone number, website, email address or anything else you can think of. After you’ve entered the text, use the formatting toolbar to create the look you want. You can select the font, font size, font design (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough), font color, fill, numbering, bullets and alignment. You can also insert hyperlinks, which means you can create clickable links to your website or email address within your email signature.</p>
                        <p>When you’ve completed your Company Details, click the green Save button at the bottom of the page. You can edit these details at any time by returning to the page, changing the details and clicking Save again.</p>

                        <p>Enter your first name, last name, email address and phone number in the fields provided.</p>

                        <p>If you want to login to your Invoice Ninja account without a password, you can do so via your other online accounts. By linking your Google, Facebook, GitHub or LinkedIn account to your Invoice Ninja account, you enable one-click login that truly makes life simpler.</p>
                        <p>To enable one click login, click the blue Enable button. A drop down menu will open, giving you the option to select an online account.
