                    <p>A process was followed to extract exactly how many people reviewed each score since <strong>play store doesn't allow to review how many people score each number</strong></p>
                    <ol id="parragraphContent">
                        <li>First, the number of reviews was extracted and placed in an excel sheet.</li>
                        <li>Second, since we can't see how many people review each score, an inspection was made to see the different bars in the reviews, it was noticed that each bar carried it's own weight. See as to that each bar carried it's own weight. The largest bar having 100% and the smalest 1%. </li>
                        <li>Third, With this information a rule of three process was followed.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Percentages of all the scores added up to 118</li>
                                <li>Users were 128</li>
                                <li>For the socre "5" it had a percentage of 100%. Therefore, to know how many people scored 100, the percentage was multiplied with 128 and divided by 118. Giving us that around 108 people scored the app with 5 stars. As seen in the next table:</li><br>
